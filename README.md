Hey there, this is a work-in-progress project I'm working on for a Library Management System that has
business and client-side functionality. There are numerous concepts incorporated into this website
such as RESTful API request, JWT Authentication, and more. The project is doing using the MERN stack
as well a second database storing different data using SQL and Sequelize. There are many features
yet to be added such as email verification, account-setup authentication, and other bugs that need
fixing.

Here are some picture of what the website includes as of now:
